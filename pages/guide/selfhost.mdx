# self-hosting

<Callout type="note">
  looking to run your own instance of amina? that's cool, but this site is for
  end users.
</Callout>

## developer documentation

all self-hosting, development, and technical docs live in the **[github wiki](/wiki/home)**.

### visit the wiki

**[Project Wiki](/wiki/home)**

everything you need:

- installation guides (local, docker, heroku, replit)
- configuration setup
- database setup (mongodb)
- lavalink for music
- dashboard deployment
- troubleshooting
- contributing guidelines

---

## why the wiki?

keeping developer docs separate makes sense:

**this site** - end users who invite amina to their servers
**the wiki** - developers who self-host or contribute

two different audiences, two different doc sets.

---

## quick links

**[github repository](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina)** — source code, issues, and pull requests

**[wiki (self-hosting)](/wiki/home)** — installation, config, and development docs

**[support server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv)** — get help with self-hosting or development

---

## still here?

if you're self-hosting amina:

1. star the [repo](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina) (appreciated)
2. follow the [wiki](/wiki/home) guides
3. join the [support server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv) if you get stuck
4. consider [supporting development](https://ko-fi.com/vikshan)

ngl, running your own bot takes work. but if you're up for it, the wiki has everything you need.
