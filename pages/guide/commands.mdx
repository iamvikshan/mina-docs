## quick start

new to my commands? here's what you need:

**see all commands:**

```
/help
```

**get help with specific command:**

```
/help command:ban
```

**check if i have permissions:**

```
/info bot
```

**configure me:**
visit [dashboard](https://4mina.app) or use `/admin` commands

---

## permissions

most commands work out of the box, but some need specific permissions:

**basic commands** (fun, music, info) - no special perms needed

**moderation commands** - need `MODERATE_MEMBERS`, `BAN_MEMBERS`, `KICK_MEMBERS`, etc.

**admin commands** - need `ADMINISTRATOR` or `MANAGE_SERVER`

**for me to work properly, i need:**

- `VIEW_CHANNELS`
- `SEND_MESSAGES`
- `EMBED_LINKS`
- `ATTACH_FILES`
- plus any command-specific perms (ban, kick, etc.)

---

## command syntax

all commands use discord's slash command system:

1. type `/` to see available commands
2. type command name (autocomplete helps)
3. fill in required parameters
4. press enter

**example:**

```
/ban <user> [reason]
      ↑       ↑
   required optional
```

**tips:**

- required parameters are in angle brackets `<>`
- optional parameters are in square brackets `[]`
- use tab to autocomplete
- hover over parameters for descriptions

---

some commands available via right-click (desktop) or long-press (mobile):

**on users:**

- get avatar
