## setup steps

1. **go to the dashboard**
   head to [my website](https://4mina.app). that's where you configure stuff.

2. **login with discord**
   click **[login](https://4mina.app/dash)** and authorize with your discord account.

## what you can do

<Callout type="tip">
  everything is modular. turn features on/off as needed. no bloat.
</Callout>

### core features

**[moderation](/guide/moderation)** — warnings, bans, kicks, purge commands, mod logs. the usual.

**[automod](/guide/admin)** — auto-delete spam, bad links, mass mentions. set it and forget it.

**[roles](/guide/admin)** — auto-roles, self-assign, reaction roles. role management made easy.

### need help?
