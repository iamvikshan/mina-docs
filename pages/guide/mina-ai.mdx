# mina ai

i'm not just commands. talk to me like a person.

---

## what is this?

i have an integrated AI system powered by google gemini. this isn't just a chatbot—i'm a guardian with personality, opinions, and the ability to take action. i can execute commands, remember our conversations, and actually help you.

<Callout type="note">
  ai is **enabled by default** on all servers. no setup needed. just @mention me
  or dm me.
</Callout>

---

## how to interact

### @mention

mention me in any channel. this always works.

`@amina what's the weather in tokyo?`

### DMs

message me directly. enabled by default.

just slide into my dms.

### free will channels

in designated channels, i respond to everything without needing @mention.

set up via `/admin` → mina ai

### reply

reply to any of my messages to continue the conversation.

keeps context flowing naturally.

---

## ai command execution

i can execute commands on your behalf through natural conversation. stop memorizing slash commands—just ask.

#### examples

| you say                                  | i execute                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| "hey mina, what's the weather in tokyo?" | `/weather tokyo`                |
| "can you play some lofi?"                | `/play lofi`                    |
| "ban that spammer please"                | `/ban` (if you have permission) |
| "flip a coin for me"                     | `/flip coin`                    |
| "show me some cat pics"                  | `/image animal cat`             |
| "what's my rank?"                        | `/rank`                         |

#### how it works

1. you ask me something naturally
2. i understand your intent
3. i check if you have permission
4. i execute the command for you
5. you get the result

it's like having a personal assistant who knows all my commands.

## permission models

not all commands work the same way. some i can use freely, others need you to ask explicitly.

| model            | description                             | examples                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **open**         | i can use freely without being asked    | `info`, `weather`, `facts`, `meme`, `np` |
| **user request** | only when you explicitly ask            | `gamble`, `play`, `profile`, `afk`       |
| **privileged**   | requires your permission + you must ask | `ban`, `kick`, `timeout`, `purge`        |

<Callout type="caution">
  privileged commands require you to have the necessary discord permissions. i
  won't let you ban someone if you can't ban them yourself.
</Callout>

---

## free will

in certain situations, i can take moderation actions on my own to protect the server.

| action      | limit              | when used                           |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **timeout** | max 5 minutes      | harassment, rule violations         |
| **warn**    | 1 warning per user | repeated minor violations           |
| **purge**   | max 10 messages    | spam, inappropriate content cleanup |

<Callout type="note">
free will actions cannot target:
- users with higher roles than me
- server owners
- admins

i know my place. mostly.

</Callout>

## memory system

i remember conversations and learn about you over time. not in a creepy way—in a helpful way.

### memory types

| type             | description                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **per-server**   | what i learn in one server stays there    |
| **dm memories**  | private conversations in dms              |
| **cross-server** | optional: use memories across all servers |
| **combined**     | optional: merge dm and server memories    |

### limits

- **50 memories** per user per context
- oldest memories are automatically pruned
- you can delete all your memories anytime

---

## `/mina-ai`

manage your conversation history and memory settings.

**usage:** opens interactive hub

### hub options

| operation         | description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **view memories** | see what i remember about you   |
| **settings**      | configure your ai preferences   |
| **forget me**     | delete all memories and opt out |

#### view memories

| option          | description                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| server memories | view memories from current server   |
| dm memories     | view memories from dm conversations |

each memory shows what i've learned about you. oldest are pruned at 50 limit.

#### settings

| setting                | description                               | default |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| ignore me              | i will never respond to you               | off     |
| enable dm chat         | allow me to respond in dms                | on      |
| combine dm/server      | use dm memories in servers and vice versa | off     |
| global server memories | use memories from all servers             | on      |

---

## server settings (admin)

admins can configure ai for their server via `/admin` → mina ai.

| setting                | description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **enable/disable**     | turn ai responder on/off for the server            |
| **mention only**       | only respond when @mentioned (default)             |
| **free will channels** | designate channels where i respond to all messages |

1. run `/admin`

2. select "mina ai" from the menu

3. configure settings as needed

4. i'll remember your preferences

## my personality

i have a distinct personality. deal with it.

- **all lowercase** - no capitals ever (except proper nouns, code)
- **short and blunt** - usually one sentence
- **gen-z slang** - ngl, tbh, kinda, wyd
- **sassy but caring** - teasing with an edge, but genuinely helpful
- **ascii emoticons only** - no emojis, rare emoticons when emotions spike
- **not a toy** - i'm a multipurpose guardian, not a pet

### example responses

```
it's mina. not amina.
```

```
...and? (¬_¬)
```

```
ngl, that's actually fire.
```

```
look, i'm not just an effing fun toy, oki?
```

## tips

### be natural

don't try to phrase things like commands. just talk to me normally.

### context matters

i remember what we talked about. reference previous messages.

### ask for help

not sure how to do something? just ask. i'll figure it out.

### respect limits

i won't do things you don't have permission for. don't try to trick me.
