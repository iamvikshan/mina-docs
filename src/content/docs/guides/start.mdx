## so you like me and want me?

cool. here's what you need to know.

## quick start

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="invite me" icon="lucide:user-plus">
    need **Manage Server** permission. that's it.
    <LinkCard title="invite link" href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1035629678632915055" />
  </Card>
  <Card title="dashboard" icon="lucide:layout-dashboard">

    <LinkCard title="open dashboard" href="https://4mina.app/dash" />
  </Card>
  <Card title="commands" icon="lucide:terminal">

    <LinkCard title="command list" href="../../commands/commands" />
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## setup steps

<Steps>
1. **go to the dashboard**  
   head to [my website](https://4mina.app). that's where you configure stuff.

2. **login with discord**  
   click **[login](https://4mina.app/dash)** and authorize with your discord account.

3. **select your server**  
   pick which server you want to configure. you'll see all servers where you have Manage Server permission.
</Steps>
