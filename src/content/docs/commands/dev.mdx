<Aside type="caution" title="restricted access">
these commands are **bot owner only**. regular users, server admins, and even server owners cannot use them.

if you're self-hosting amina, check the [wiki](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki) for developer documentation.
</Aside>

## what are dev commands?

dev commands are internal tools used by amina's developer (vikshan) for:
- diagnosing issues
- testing new features
- managing premium users
- monitoring bot health across servers
- emergency maintenance

**you cannot access these.** they're hardcoded to specific developer discord ids.

---

## available dev commands

for transparency, here's what exists (but you can't use):

### `/dev`

developer dashboard with subcommands for:
- server list and stats
- system diagnostics
- feature flags and testing
- database queries
- error logs

**access:** bot owner only  
**why restricted:** full system access, could break things

---

### `/premium`

manage premium subscriptions.

**subcommands:**
- `/premium add` - grant premium to a user/server
- `/premium remove` - revoke premium access

**access:** bot owner only  
**why restricted:** controls paid features

---

### `/zzz`

internal testing command for development.

**access:** bot owner only  
**why restricted:** experimental features, unstable

---

## for self-hosters

if you're running your own instance of amina:

1. **read the wiki** - [github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki)
2. **set your dev id** - configure your discord id in the bot's environment
3. **understand the risks** - dev commands have full bot access

self-hosting documentation is kept separate from these user docs because:
- different audience (developers vs server owners)
- technical setup instructions don't belong here
- keeps this site focused on using amina, not hosting it

---

## why not document these fully?

these docs are for **people using amina in their servers**, not for:
- bot developers
- self-hosters
- people running their own instance

if you want to:
- **use amina in your server** → you're in the right place
- **self-host amina** → check the [wiki](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki)
- **contribute code** → see [github repo](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina)

need help with regular commands? check out the [admin & setup](/commands/admin) category - that's where the powerful (but accessible) commands live.
