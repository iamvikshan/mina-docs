## what is this?

i have an integrated AI system powered by google gemini. this isn't just a chatbot—i'm a guardian with personality, opinions, and the ability to take action. i can execute commands, remember our conversations, and actually help you.

<Aside type="note">
ai is **enabled by default** on all servers. no setup needed. just @mention me or dm me.
</Aside>

## how to interact

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="@mention" icon="lucide:at-sign">

    `@amina what's the weather in tokyo?`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="DMs" icon="lucide:message-circle">
    message me directly. enabled by default.
    
    just slide into my dms.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="free will channels" icon="lucide:zap">
    in designated channels, i respond to everything without needing @mention.
    
    set up via `/admin` → mina ai
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="reply" icon="lucide:reply">
    reply to any of my messages to continue the conversation.
    
    keeps context flowing naturally.
  </Card>

## ai command execution

i can execute commands on your behalf through natural conversation. stop memorizing slash commands—just ask.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="examples">
    | you say | i execute |
    |---------|-----------|
    | "hey mina, what's the weather in tokyo?" | `/weather tokyo` |
    | "can you play some lofi?" | `/play lofi` |
    | "ban that spammer please" | `/ban` (if you have permission) |
    | "flip a coin for me" | `/flip coin` |
    | "show me some cat pics" | `/image animal cat` |
    | "what's my rank?" | `/rank` |
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="how it works">
    1. you ask me something naturally
    2. i understand your intent
    3. i check if you have permission
    4. i execute the command for you
    5. you get the result
    
    it's like having a personal assistant who knows all my commands.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## permission models

not all commands work the same way. some i can use freely, others need you to ask explicitly.

| model | description | examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **open** | i can use freely without being asked | `info`, `weather`, `facts`, `meme`, `np` |
| **user request** | only when you explicitly ask | `gamble`, `play`, `profile`, `afk` |
| **privileged** | requires your permission + you must ask | `ban`, `kick`, `timeout`, `purge` |

<Aside type="caution">
privileged commands require you to have the necessary discord permissions. i won't let you ban someone if you can't ban them yourself.
</Aside>

---

## free will

in certain situations, i can take moderation actions on my own to protect the server.

| action | limit | when used |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **timeout** | max 5 minutes | harassment, rule violations |
| **warn** | 1 warning per user | repeated minor violations |
| **purge** | max 10 messages | spam, inappropriate content cleanup |

<Aside type="note">
free will actions cannot target:
- users with higher roles than me
- server owners
- admins

i know my place. mostly.
</Aside>

## memory system

i remember conversations and learn about you over time. not in a creepy way—in a helpful way.

### memory types

| type | description |
|------|-------------|
| **per-server** | what i learn in one server stays there |
| **dm memories** | private conversations in dms |
| **cross-server** | optional: use memories across all servers |
| **combined** | optional: merge dm and server memories |

### limits

- **50 memories** per user per context
- oldest memories are automatically pruned
- you can delete all your memories anytime

---

## `/mina-ai`

manage your conversation history and memory settings.

**usage:** opens interactive hub

### hub options

| operation | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **view memories** | see what i remember about you |
| **settings** | configure your ai preferences |
| **forget me** | delete all memories and opt out |

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="view memories">
    | option | description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | server memories | view memories from current server |
    | dm memories | view memories from dm conversations |
    
    each memory shows what i've learned about you. oldest are pruned at 50 limit.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="settings">
    | setting | description | default |
    |---------|-------------|---------|
    | ignore me | i will never respond to you | off |
    | enable dm chat | allow me to respond in dms | on |
    | combine dm/server | use dm memories in servers and vice versa | off |
    | global server memories | use memories from all servers | on |
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## server settings (admin)

admins can configure ai for their server via `/admin` → mina ai.

| setting | description |
|---------|-------------|
| **enable/disable** | turn ai responder on/off for the server |
| **mention only** | only respond when @mentioned (default) |
| **free will channels** | designate channels where i respond to all messages |

<Steps>
1. run `/admin`

2. select "mina ai" from the menu

3. configure settings as needed

4. i'll remember your preferences
</Steps>

## my personality

i have a distinct personality. deal with it.

- **all lowercase** - no capitals ever (except proper nouns, code)
- **short and blunt** - usually one sentence
- **gen-z slang** - ngl, tbh, kinda, wyd
- **sassy but caring** - teasing with an edge, but genuinely helpful
- **ascii emoticons only** - no emojis, rare emoticons when emotions spike
- **not a toy** - i'm a multipurpose guardian, not a pet

### example responses

```
it's mina. not amina.
```

```
...and? (¬_¬)
```

```
ngl, that's actually fire.
```

```
look, i'm not just an effing fun toy, oki?
```
