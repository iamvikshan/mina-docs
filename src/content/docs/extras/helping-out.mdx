## code

amina is open source and written in discord.js. check out the [repo](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina).

</Steps>

**what we need:**
- bug fixes (check [issues](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/issues))

- new features (discuss first in discord/issues)
- tests and documentation

**what we don't need:**
- random rewrites without discussion
- features that don't fit amina's purpose
- code that breaks existing functionality

## support development

<LinkCard
  title="support on ko-fi"
  description="one-time or monthly support. helps keep amina running."
  href="https://ko-fi.com/vikshan"
/>

<LinkCard
  title="support on patreon"
  description="monthly support with perks. early access to features."
  href="https://patreon.com/vikshan"

ngl, running a bot costs money (hosting, api costs, etc). if amina helps your server, consider supporting development.
