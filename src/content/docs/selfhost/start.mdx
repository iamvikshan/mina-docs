# self-hosting

<Aside type="note">
looking to run your own instance of amina? that's cool, but this site is for end users.
</Aside>

## developer documentation

all self-hosting, development, and technical docs live in the **[github wiki](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki)**.

<Card title="visit the wiki" icon="lucide:book-open">
  **[github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki)**
  
  everything you need:
  - installation guides (local, docker, heroku, replit)
  - configuration setup
  - database setup (mongodb)
  - lavalink for music
  - dashboard deployment
  - troubleshooting
  - contributing guidelines
</Card>

## why the wiki?

keeping developer docs separate makes sense:

**this site** - end users who invite amina to their servers  
**the wiki** - developers who self-host or contribute

two different audiences, two different doc sets.

## still here?

if you're self-hosting amina:
1. star the [repo](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina) (appreciated)
2. follow the [wiki](https://github.com/iamvikshan/amina/wiki) guides
3. join the [support server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv) if you get stuck
4. consider [supporting development](https://ko-fi.com/vikshan)

ngl, running your own bot takes work. but if you're up for it, the wiki has everything you need.
