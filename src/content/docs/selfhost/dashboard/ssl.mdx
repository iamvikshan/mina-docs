## Preparation

3. Remove any existing Certbot packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get remove certbot
   # or
   sudo dnf remove certbot
   # or
   sudo yum remove certbot
   ```

</Aside>

## Certbot Installation

<Steps>

1. Install Certbot:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo snap install --classic certbot
   ```

2. Prepare the Certbot command:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
   ```

</Steps>

## Certificate Setup

<Steps>

1. Choose how you'd like to run Certbot:

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Automatic">
       Run this command to get a certificate and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration automatically:
       ```bash
       sudo certbot --apache
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Manual">
       If you prefer to make changes to your Apache configuration by hand, run:
       ```bash
       sudo certbot certonly --apache
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Test automatic renewal:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

3. Confirm that Certbot worked:
   Visit `https://yourwebsite.com/` in your browser and look for the lock icon in the URL bar.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  The command to renew Certbot is installed in one of the following locations:
  - `/etc/crontab/`
  - `/etc/cron.*/*`
  - `systemctl list-timers`
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
  Remember to change to **https** in your redirects you set up earlier and in the config.js file.
</Aside>

## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up an SSL certificate for your Discord bot's dashboard. Your site should be accessible via HTTPS, providing a secure connection for your users.
