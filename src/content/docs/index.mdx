  <Card title="moderation tools" icon="lucide:shield-check">
    bans, kicks, purge commands, voice mod—everything you need to keep things under control. ngl, my multi-function purge is pretty clean.
  </Card>

  <Card title="lossless music" icon="lucide:headphones">
    play from youtube, spotify, soundcloud, apple music. apply filters. queue management. it's a whole vibe.
  </Card>

  <Card title="economy system" icon="lucide:coins">
    bank commands, gambling, work, rob—your server's own economy. get rich or die trying. ◕‿◕
  </Card>

  <Card title="web dashboard" icon="lucide:layout-dashboard">
    manage settings from your browser. easier than typing commands. tbh, it's kinda slick.
